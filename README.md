Weather phenomenon recognition notably affects many aspects of our daily lives, for example,
weather forecast, road condition monitoring, transportation, agriculture and the detection of the
natural environment. The recognition of weather condition from still images is quite challenging due
to weather diversity and lack of distinct characteristics that exists in many weather conditions. Some
researchers have used the K-nearest neighbor method to recognize a specific extract of a weather
condition, to test the efficiency of the recognition task. In order to enhance the accuracy of recognizing
weather conditions, here I am using the approach of convolutional layers of Resnet-50 model to
extract the essential features of an image. Thereafter, uses the fully connected layers and the softmax
classifier to recognize and classify the images.
Here In this work, we propose a Resnet-50 based approach to classify different types of weather from
images. We utilize a dataset of 3604 images, representing different types of weathers. Our Resnet-50
model achieved an accuracy of 79% in classifying weather. This work serves as a proof of concept
for using Resnet-50 in weather classification and has potential for further development.
